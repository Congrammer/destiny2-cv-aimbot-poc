# Destiny 2 Computer Vision Aimbot POC

## Project Motivation
Cloud gaming platforms such as Stadia are popular alternatives to PC for competitive PVP gamemodes because cloud hosted games are immune to tradisional cheats. Tradisional cheats require access to client side process memory, code and network traffic. With cloud hosted games the user has no way to tamper with the internals of the game. 

The primary motivation for this project is to create a proof of concept for an external aimbot that will function with cloud hosted games. The secondary motivation for this project is to exercise my programming skills in a computer vision context. 

## Disclaimer
I have no intent on productionization and ditributing this aimbot. This project is purely a POC to demonstrate that a computer vision approach for an aimbot is possible for cloud hosted games. I have no intent of using this aimbot in actual game play as the the computational requirements and aimbot accuracy will be unpractical.
